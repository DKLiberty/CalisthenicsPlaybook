FOREWORD

> Looking back at the earliest days of
> [<u>Gravgear</u>](https://thegravgear.com/), I realized our approach
> was flawed. Posting product images on Instagram felt intrusive, almost
> like spam. It went against my central belief: to offer value before
> asking for anything in return.
>
> Growing up, I found two passions that ignited my spirit - calisthenics
> and drawing. The former unlocked the impressive capabilities of our
> bodies, and the latter brought my creative ideas to life. Suddenly, it
> hit me: why not blend these passions?
>
> Thus, Yellow Dude was born - a fusion of fitness insights and playful
> sketches. The response was astounding. The content resonated so
> strongly that I devoted myself to creating these pieces for two years,
> rarely mentioning Gravgear. Yellow Dude didn't generate revenue, but
> it brought immeasurable joy.
>
> The affection that Yellow Dude received indicated it was time for him
> to evolve into his own brand. This book marks that transformation. It
> is a curated compilation of our shared social media content, enhanced
> with refined illustrations and valuable insights from experienced
> coaches, offering a guide that is both enjoyable and actionable.

The book unfolds with three key sections, each designed to help master a
unique skill: one-arm push-ups, pull-ups, and pistol squats.

Each section is filled with at least seven workouts, progressing from
straightforward to more challenging ones. Detailed tips accompany these
workouts, with some even based on scientific research. Since many
individuals tend to neglect pull-oriented workouts, the book introduces
warm-up exercises specifically for the pull-ups section. These workouts
prime your back muscles and prepare them for the main routines.

In the end, the Routine section lays out a gradual progression for all
the workouts across each section. It provides a clear, step-by-step plan
that makes mastering each skill more manageable.
